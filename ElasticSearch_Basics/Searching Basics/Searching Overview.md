One of the core strengths of Elasticsearch is its search capabilities. Following topics cover basics of searching in Elastic Search:
- The basics of text analysis
- Searching from structured data
- Writing compound queries
- Searching from full-text
- Modeling relationships

# Basics of text analysis
The analysis of text data is different from other types of data analysis, such as numbers, dates, and times. The analysis of numeric and date/time datatypes can be done in a very definitive way. 

However, the analysis of text/string data can be different. Text data can be of a different nature, and it can be used for structured or unstructured analysis.

Some examples of structured types of string fields are as follows: country codes, product codes, non-numeric serial numbers/identifiers, and so on. The datatype of these fields may be a string, but often you may want to do exact-match queries on these fields. 

The analysis of unstructured text,which is also known as full-text search.
All fields that are of the text type are analyzed by what is known as an analyzer.
